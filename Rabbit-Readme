The descriptions of Rabbit project

The main function of the application allows user to send the message which is a video or an image to their friend
and the messages only last about 10s after user views the message for the first time. It is totally secure when you want
to send your friend a private picture or video just for view one-time. Another features of the application are :

+ User registrations.
+ Adding Friends + Remove Friends
+ View messages in the Inbox Tab.
+ Take a videos or pictures,and choose the recipients
+ All user information and message are stored in cloud at Parse.com
+ I use Parse.com at the back-end services. So i also implement some techniques such as Back-End services. It's support
some techniques like, doing background work, grand central dispatch and dashboard reporting.
